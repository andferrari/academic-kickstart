It will particularly focus on the implementation striking a balance between theory and coding.\nObjectives The main objective is to be able to derive a possibly optimal algorithm to solve a given practical estimation problem.

The Bayesian paradigm, coupled with efficient simulation algorithms, has been proved to be a computationally efficient alternative to classical frequentist approaches.\nThe Bayesian formalism is also recognized as a natural framework to address inverse problems which arise in many observational systems. A large part of the course is devoted to the application of Bayesian models to image reconstruction in astrophysics. It will particularly focus on choice of the priors and the implementation.\nTheory A common problem in experimental and observational sciences is to extract information from noisy measurements. Bayesian analysis is the formalism which allows to merge in the inference: 1. the information brought by the measurements, 2. a prior on the solution.\nThis approach is experiencing an increasing interest since the early 1990\u0026rsquo;s after new simulations methods appeared. Since a decade, the Bayesian paradigm coupled with hierarchical models is used to solve computationally involving problems where mathematical optimization algorithms are replaced by increasingly effective simulations methods.\nBesides the power of recent computational Bayesian approaches, the Bayesian formalism plays also a central role in the resolution of inverse problems.\nMany data processing problems in physics, and in particular in astrophysics, can be formalized as an inverse problem where the measured data is related in a complex way to the properties of the target. This includes image deconvolution (e.g. deblurring and denoising), image reconstruction (e.g. in radioastronomy or optical interferometry), image segmentation\u0026hellip; The resolution of these ill-posed problems require a regularization (or prior) and the Bayesian formalism is proved to be the natural framework to address these problems.\nApplications A large part of the course is devoted to practical projects, where the students will code various algorithms and compare theoretical results with simulation results. Students will have to complete three projects during the course and are welcomed to work in pairs and to submit a single document.

For instance, in forestry applications, infected trees are considered as artifacts, as well as water pollution in coastal clear waters. Contrarily to the target detection problem where the spectra of the target must be known, artifact detection methods generally assume no prior information about the spectra of the pixels, in both nominal and abnormal cases. State-of-the-art algorithms use reference data either from a local neighborhood around the pixel/spectrum to be tested, either using all or part of the HSI data possibly at a different time instant. The most popular among these algorithms are the Reed-Xiaoli Detector (RXD) [1] and its many variations. More recently algorithms using deep convolutional neural networks have proved their effectiveness for this task [2].\nAll these approaches rely on pairs of learning and testing spectra sets which are performed on images processed on ground and geometrically, spectrally and radiometrically calibrated. Moreover, these algorithms consist of a learning step and a testing step on two set of patches acquired at different time instant and so don’t allow a fully (learning and testing) line by line processing in order to process a continuous flow of data. The objectives of this PhD will be to develop an artifact detection algorithm, computationally efficient and compatible with data as acquired by the pushbroom sensor i.e. line by line and before radiometrically, spectral and geometric corrections and calibrations, which takes advantage of recent advances in machine learning.\nWe propose to develop anomaly line by line artifact detection algorithm which processes sensor output data flow compatible with the pushbroom acquisition: a new line of ground swath is processed at each iteration of the algorithm in order to decide, and to localize if needed, whether one or more artifacts are present. The decision will take into account spatial and spectral information acquired across the past scanned line swaths and the new line swath. Note that a similar approach was recently proposed for online deconvolution of hyperspectral images acquired using a fixed industrial imaging system above a conveyor belt in [3].\nWe propose to address the lack of data calibration using a learning algorithm which gives more weight to measurements acquired near the decision zone. The first approach we will investigate is an adaptive strategy where two classifiers are learned simultaneously using two distinct learning rates: the rationale behind this idea is that the classifier with the larger learning rate gives “more importance” to recent samples than the other classifier, so the distance between the two classifiers outputs should increase in case of a spatially localized change. The principle of comparing two classifiers outputs with different learning rates is well-known in the field of time series processing, see for example [4]. It has recently been proposed in [5] for change point detection in time series data in conjunction with more recent machine learning techniques. In [6] this strategy is applied to the problem of change point detection in signals on graphs. To our knowledge, these approaches have not yet been applied for detecting artifacts in multispectral images acquired by pushbroom systems. A particular effort will be made to develop appropriate classifiers that take into account information related to the spatial and spectral coherence of an artifact. In this context, kernel-based models and convolutional neural network models are candidates that will be studied.\nTo our knowledge, these approaches have not yet been applied for detecting artifacts in multispectral images acquired by pushbroom systems.

For this purpose, Thales Alenia Space will provide for the same scene both: raw camera data sets and fully calibrated datasets. These datasets will make it possible to quantify the performance degradation associated with processing of uncalibrated data. The dataset foreseen are of 2 types : Sentinel 3/OLCI data acquired during the In Orbit Commissioning Review, and simulated CHIME data performed for the CHIME phase A/B1 per-development study.

Application to hyperspectral imaging Detecting changes in network-structured time series data is of utmost importance in critical applications as diverse as detecting denial of service attacks against online service providers or monitoring energy and water supplies.\nWe recently devised an online change-point detection algorithm in [1,2] that fully benefits from the recent advances in graph signal processing to exploit the characteristics of the data that lie on irregular supports. The algorithm is able to detect anomalous clusters of activity over time in streaming scalar data measured at each node of the graph in a distributed manner across nodes.\nA natural extension is to tackle the case where the measurement at each node is vectored value. This paves the way to many applications such as the detection of changes in hyper spectral images where a node is associated to each pixel, the graph models spatial dependences between pixels and each node is associated to the corresponding spectrum. The internship will focus on theoretical aspects related to the development of a multivariate detection algorithm, including multivariate graph signal processing, and practical application to change detection in multi temporal hyperspectral images.\nThis is a joint work with Cédric Richard.\nTo apply for this intership, please contact me.\n When? 4-6 months, spring 2020 Where?
