I am currently a professor at the Laboratoire [J.-L. Lagrange](https://lagrange.oca.eu/), a joint laboratory between [Université Côte d'Azur](http://univ-cotedazur.fr/), [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) and [Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur](https://www.oca.eu/).

My current research  activity is centered around statistical data processing, inverse problems and machine learning. I have a particular interest in applications to Astrophysics, such as radio interferometry, and hyperspectral imaging.

My recent interests include processing of streamed measurements with complex structures
which can be encoded in a graph. An example of application is the detection of
changes in a stream of images.
