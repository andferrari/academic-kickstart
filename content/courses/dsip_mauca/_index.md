The objective of this course is to present the fundamental mathematics and concepts of discrete-time signal and image processing. 
These topics are presented in the context of signal processing and extended to image processing. 
A large part of the course will be devoted to computer implementation of signal and image processing systems.

## Practical work

A large part of the course is devoted to 4 practical projects, where the students will code various algorithms and compare theoretical results with simulation results.  
1. Signal filtering
2. Fourier analysis and circular convolution
3. Image processing
4. Wavelets analysis

Students will have to complete these projects during the course and are welcomed to work in pairs and to submit a single document. The computations will be preferentially carried out in julia or python.
