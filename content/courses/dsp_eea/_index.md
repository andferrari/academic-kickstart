## Desription

This course will introduce the students to the fundamental of discrete-time signal processing. 
It will particularly focus on:
- Discrete-time signals and systems, convolution
- The z-transform
- Sampling of continuous-time signals
- Transform analysis of linear time-invariant systems
- Fourier transforms: FT, DFT and FFT
- Introduction to filter design techniques.

A large part of the course is devoted to practical projects, where the students will code various algorithms and compare theoretical results with simulation results.

## Piazza

All the annoucements will be posted on Piazza. Students are also encouraged to post questions on Piazza.

## Homework

Students will have to complete a project during the course. You must submit for each project a pdf export of a jupyter notebook including the code, plots and a detailed report. Your are welcomed to work in pairs and to submit a single document.

Due dates will be posted on the website along with the assignments. Late homework will not be accepted.

## Software

In this course we will be using [Julia](https://julialang.org).
